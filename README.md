# Desciption
This is a basic password manager. The program allows you to add account names and passwards and store then in a generated .txt file. For security purposes the .txt file will show the passwords as encrypted and the only way to view them is with the view option within the program. Later on more will be added. Such as the master key function that initially was supposed to be implemented.
